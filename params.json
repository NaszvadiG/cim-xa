{"name":"Cim-xa","tagline":"CIM-Accelerant [a.k.a. CIM-XA] is a distribution for the popular CodeIgniter framework, including zero-compilation object-oriented data layers [using PDO via Idiorm] and presentation layers [using Savant and PHPTI] as well as MongoDB support, job queue support, the Grocery CRUD, PHPExcel and  Zend libraries, all backed by ChromePHP for testing. By:","body":"*CIM-ACCELERANT [A.K.A. CIM-XA]*\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nA distribution, by Titanium Opensystems, l.c., including the popular CodeIgniter framework and many extensions. You may find this \r\ndistribution helpful if your situation includes one or more of the following:\r\n- You need PDO for cross-DBMS compatibility or HipHopVM [HHVM] compatibility \r\n- You need support for SQL prepared statements \r\n- You need or simply prefer a more mainstream ORM approach\r\n- You need template inheritance without doing compile steps \r\n- You need web analytics [piwik]\r\n- You need login/authorization \r\n- You need a module code structure or HMVC \r\n- You need a very quick CRUD system [with one or more cruds per page]\r\n- You need MongoDB support \r\n- You need strong Excel data support\r\n- You need a powerful rule engine\r\n- You need a job queue facility [i.e.:batch/asynchronous processing]\r\n- You need debugging via Chrome Console\r\n- You need a cURL library\r\n- You need phpseclib [for more security choices]\r\n- You need HTML email -- if you also need a css inliner, see: beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css\r\n\r\nThis distribution includes 100% PHP, zero-compilation, object-oriented data and presentation layers [CodeIgniter views remain usable if desired], \r\nsupports SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL [with prepared statements through PDO] and also includes the Grocery [CRUD], PHPExcel and Zend libraries \r\n[auth, mail, permissions, etc., loadable and usable as if they were CodeIgniter libraries], as well as ChromePHP [for testing] \r\nand PHPTI for simple painless template inhertiance. MongoDB support is included using CodeIgniter active record systax [i.e.: not Idiorm]. \r\nThis distribution therefore stands on the shoulders of some PHP giants including Ellis Labs (CodeIgniter), Jamie Matthews (Paris, Idiorm), \r\nPaul M. Jones (Savant), Zend(Zend libraries), Adam Shaw (phpti), Alex Bilbie (MongoDB library) and others. \r\n\r\nSome Useful External Resources\r\n-----------------\r\n<a href=\"http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/toc.html\">Documentation for CodeIgniter</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://idiorm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Documentation for Idiorm Object Relational Mapper</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://paris.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Documentation for Paris Active Record [Optional] Add-on for Idiorm</a> \r\n\r\nWhile Paris is included in this distribution it is not necessary to use for the database layer--it merely provides an alternative \r\nabstraction. The sample code in application/controllers/songs.php uses Idiorm only.\r\nSHOULD I USE IDIORM ALONE OR IDIORM+PARIS? <a href=\"http://j4mie.github.io/idiormandparis/\">See the Idiorm and Paris story here</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://phpsavant.com/docs/\">Documentation for [optional] Savant Templating</a> and see also: \r\n<a href=\"http://devzone.zend.com/1542/creating-modular-template-based-interfaces-with-savant/\">this article</a>. \r\n\r\nWhile Savant is included in this distribution, it is not mandatory to use Savant for presentation -- CodeIgniter views may be used. \r\nThe sample code in application/controllers/songs.php has an example of each type of view. If used, CodeIgniter views are located \r\nin the usual directory. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://phpti.com/\">Documentation for [optional] PHPTI Template Inheritance</a>. \r\n\r\nJob queue functionality requires enabling Python and is based on the following projeects: \r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hussaintamboli/Celery-CI\">Celery-CI</a> [housed in /application/libraries]\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gjedeer/celery-php\">Celery-PHP</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/amqp.setup.php\">AMQP</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.toforge.com/2011/01/run-celery-tasks-from-php/\">Run Celery Tasks Article</a>\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\nLibraries are housed in / or in /application/libraries, except as noted in the various README files in /. \r\nThis distribution's configuration for CodeIgniter departs from the original as follows: \r\n- csrf_protection is set to: TRUE[CSRF protection may be turned off for a particular function, such as a web service, with: \r\n$CFG =& load_class('Config', 'core'); $CFG->set_item('csrf_protection', FALSE);] \r\n- index_page is set to: ' ' to support URLs without showing index.php. \r\n\r\nOther considerations:\r\n- IMPORTANT: <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.security.php\">See PHP session security details here</a>. \r\n- if sessions are needed then PHP or Zend sessions should be used instead of CodeIgniter's. \r\n- If you use CI's Encryption class or CI's Session class you MUST set an encryption key.  See application/config/config.php\r\n- this distribution's Savant departs from the original in that it assumes the path to templates is set to application/templates \r\nand the sample code reflects this assumption. \r\n- a database connection string configuration for Idiorm is located in application/config/idiorm.php which you may include in your \r\ncontroller constructor, otherwise Idiom expects it coded inline. This string must reflect your database server attributes as \r\ndescribed in the Idiorm documentation. \r\n- to use Grocery CRUD requires defining CodeIgniter's database connection in application/config/database.php. \r\n\r\nSample Code\r\n-----------\r\nTHERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE CONTROLLER in application/controllers/site.php including examples of several forms of usage. There is also a \r\nsample controller for job queues in application/controllers/jobq.php.\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n**THIS DISTRIBUTION IS LICENSED AS A COMPILATION WORK UNDER THE SAME TERMS AS SET FORTH IN \r\n<A HREF=\"HTTP://ELLISLAB.COM/CODEIGNITER/USER-GUIDE/LICENSE.HTML\">THE CODEIGNITER LICENSE</A>.
