<p>A distribution, by Titanium Opensystems, l.c., including the popular CodeIgniter framework and many extensions. You may find this 
distribution helpful if your situation includes one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need PDO for cross-DBMS compatibility or HipHopVM [HHVM] compatibility </li>
<li>You need support for SQL prepared statements </li>
<li>You need or simply prefer a more mainstream ORM approach</li>
<li>You need template inheritance without doing compile steps </li>
<li>You need web analytics [piwik]</li>
<li>You need login/authorization </li>
<li>You need a module code structure or HMVC </li>
<li>You need a very quick CRUD system [with one or more cruds per page]</li>
<li>You need MongoDB support </li>
<li>You need strong Excel data support</li>
<li>You need a powerful rule engine</li>
<li>You need a job queue facility [i.e.:batch/asynchronous processing]</li>
<li>You need debugging via Chrome Console</li>
<li>You need a cURL library</li>
<li>You need phpseclib [for more security choices]</li>
<li>You need HTML email -- if you also need a css inliner, see: beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css</li>
</ul><p>This distribution includes 100% PHP, zero-compilation, object-oriented data and presentation layers [CodeIgniter views remain usable if desired], 
supports SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL [with prepared statements through PDO] and also includes the Grocery [CRUD], PHPExcel and Zend libraries 
[auth, mail, permissions, etc., loadable and usable as if they were CodeIgniter libraries], as well as ChromePHP [for testing] 
and PHPTI for simple painless template inhertiance. MongoDB support is included using CodeIgniter active record systax [i.e.: not Idiorm]. 
This distribution therefore stands on the shoulders of some PHP giants including Ellis Labs (CodeIgniter), Jamie Matthews (Paris, Idiorm), 
Paul M. Jones (Savant), Zend(Zend libraries), Adam Shaw (phpti), Alex Bilbie (MongoDB library) and others. </p>

<p>While Paris is included in this distribution it is not necessary to use for the database layer--it merely provides an alternative 
abstraction. The sample code in application/controllers/songs.php uses Idiorm only.

<p>While Savant is included in this distribution, it is not mandatory to use Savant for presentation -- CodeIgniter views may be used. 
The sample code in application/controllers/songs.php has an example of each type of view. If used, CodeIgniter views are located 
in the usual directory. </p>

<a name="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>Libraries are housed in / or in /application/libraries, except as noted in the various README files in /. 
This distribution's configuration for CodeIgniter departs from the original as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>csrf_protection is set to: TRUE[CSRF protection may be turned off for a particular function, such as a web service, with: 
$CFG =&amp; load_class('Config', 'core'); $CFG-&gt;set_item('csrf_protection', FALSE);] </li>
<li>index_page is set to: ' ' to support URLs without showing index.php. </li>
</ul><p>Other considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.security.php">See PHP session security details here</a>. </li>
<li>if sessions are needed then PHP or Zend sessions should be used instead of CodeIgniter's. </li>
<li>If you use CI's Encryption class or CI's Session class you MUST set an encryption key.  See application/config/config.php</li>
<li>this distribution's Savant departs from the original in that it assumes the path to templates is set to application/templates 
and the sample code reflects this assumption. </li>
<li>a database connection string configuration for Idiorm is located in application/config/idiorm.php which you may include in your 
controller constructor, otherwise Idiom expects it coded inline. This string must reflect your database server attributes as 
described in the Idiorm documentation. </li>
<li>to use Grocery CRUD requires defining CodeIgniter's database connection in application/config/database.php. </li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="sample-code" class="anchor" href="#sample-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sample Code</h2>

<p>THERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE CONTROLLER in application/controllers/site.php including examples of several forms of usage. There is also a 
sample controller for job queues in application/controllers/jobq.php.</p>
